The Digital SEL API the [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) backend of the Digital SEL, a digital
humanities project whose aim is to provide a sophisticated, interactive digital edition of the
[South English Legendary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_English_Legendary), an important
collection of [Middle English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English) [saints' lives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagiography) from the
[Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages).

For more information about the project see the
[Digital SEL Blog](http://blog.digitalsel.org/). For a very very early version of the project
(written before the [maintainer](http://william-bolton.com/) was a software engineer) see the
[DigitalSEL.org](http://digitalsel.org/).

If you are new to development and need help, please feel free to reach out to me via Twitter

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [RVM](https://rvm.io/)
- Ruby 2.4.4
- Rails 5.2.0
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

If you are not sure about how to install the prerequisites, follow this guide.

### Setup the project for development

After you have your database server running, create and migrate the database:

    rails db:create

    rails db:migrate

Run the server:

    rails s

### Run the tests

    rspec

### Run the linter

    rubocop

### Database Maintenance

Though database state is not important to the software, it is very important to the project.

Make a snapshot of the database:

Run

    make ENV=development snapshot

or copy and paste

    pg_dump --no-acl --no-owner --clean dsel_development | gzip > dsel_development`date -u +'%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M-%SZ'`.sql.gz

Restore a snapshot of the database:

    gunzip -c $FILENAME | psql dsel_development

### API Specs / Postman

A maintianed Postman collection of the API may be found in `/postman`. Set the environment variable
`base_url` to `https://api.digitalsel.com` to use the collection against production.
