[…]eyn beryn þe confessour ; þat good man was ynowh
[…]i  romayne was in rome yboren ; to goodnes euere he drowh
to clennes alle he drowh ; ful ȝonge to grete penaunce also
[…]e leued all ys lyfe ; soo as hee myȝht it do
To þe pope ys name come ; þat was so wyde spronge
Þe pope lete hym sone of sende ; hym þowht it er ful longe
Whan þis good man to hym come ; hee worschepid hym ynowh
And most also in priuyte ; hym to hym he drowh
Soo þat a byschope hee hym made ; in contre þere besyde
Þe fame þan of ys good lyfe ; sprynged fer & wyde
And syþen þe pope it vndirstood ; þat hee must sende ys sonde
To amende cristendome ; heere in yngelonde
For þe folke of yngelonde ; lyued nat þan ariȝht
Hee þowht to make anone ; seint beryn crystes knyȝht
Hee sente hym into yngelonde ; to preche cristendome
Seynt beryn þan in crystes name ; hyderwarde he come
Þe pope a litil lynnen cloþe ; as it a purse were
Toke hym with oure lordes flesche ; þat hee it with hym beere
Aboute hys necke where he come ; þe pepil ariht to lere
For þe deuyl haþ of no þinge ; in herthe so grete feere
Whan þis man come to þe see ; þere in hee nolde hym doo
Or hee hadde hys masse y sayde ; & oþere beedes also
