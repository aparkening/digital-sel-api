SEint Byrin þe confessour ; þat godeman was .y. nouh
In þe toun of Rome was boren ; & to eche godenesse drouh .
To clannesse he drou wel ȝong ; & to penaunce also ;
Þer inne he wex so alwey ; as he myght it do .
Þat eche day hadde somdel newe ; þat him ouer sprong ;
& þe lattere day more & more ; nere it nouht so long .
Me thinkeþ suche waxing was goed ; who so it myght do ;
Wide sprong his gode los ; as it most neode also .
To þe pope honory ; þat was þo it sprong ;
Þe pope him lette sone of sende ; him þohut er wel long .

And mest in his priuetes . aboute him wiþ him drouh .
¶ So þat he made him bisshop ; in þe lond þer besyde ;
Þe los of his godenes . if it er sprong wide .

So þat in þe lond þo ; men ne fond his per .

Tok him wiþ oure lordes flehs ; þat he wiþ him bere .
¶ About his necke wher he comm . þat folk forto lere .
For of noþing þe deouel haþ ; on eorþe so mychel fere .
= Þo seint biryn com to þe see ; he nolde him not in do ;
Er he hadde his masse songe ; & his oþere bedes also .

Þat he forȝat bihinde his cloth . as it were be cas .

¶ Seint Biryn beþouht him anon ; þat he forȝat behynde ;
And bad þe shipman turne aȝein . if he myght it fynde .

And went aȝein vpon þe see ; as he hadde er .y. do .
¶ To þe ship he com aȝen ; & fond it ryght þere ;
For al þe gret tempest . as he leued it ere .
= Wel softe he stap in aȝein ; al drye & al clene ;
Þer nas non so litel clout of him ; þat were .y. wet ene .

For among many faire myracles ; me thinkeþ þis was on .

¶ Þis woman þo she she awaked . ne forȝat it nouht ;
Reste nolde she haue non ; er she were to him brouht .

Seint Biryn hire made to haue ; hire eyen & hire ere .
= & helede hire befornn al þe folk ; þat men wondred y now ;

In þe contre of oxenford ; he prechede godes lore .j. nouh .
