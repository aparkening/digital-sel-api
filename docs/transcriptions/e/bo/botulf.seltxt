Seint Botulf þe holi monk . and Adulf is broþer
Ibore were in engelond . as is mani anoþer .
Hi bigonne boþe ȝonge . to ech godnesse drawe
And at o conseil were boþe . to louie godes lawe .
So þat hi nome to rede . ouer þe see to wende
To lerne bet of godeslore . as oure lord hem wolte sende
Biȝende þe see hi wenden . & longe leueden þere
In an hous of ordre . among monkes hi were .
Vorto lerne þe ordre ariȝt . þat no defaute nere .
Here gode los vaste sprong . vram ȝere to ȝere .
So þat þe king of þe lond . preisede here lif vaste
Vor here grete holinesse . his herte vpon hem he caste .
Þe eldore broþer he made þer . bischop seint adolf
And al so he þouȝte . to make seint Botulf .
Ac seint Botulf þouȝte nouȝt . þere longe astonde
He wilnede do is ordre . at hom in engelonde .
Þo is broþer bischop was . he nom leue to wende
To is ordre to engelond . & þer is lif to ende .
And bede hire merci of hire gult . & were iknowe anon .
In þe hous þat he was inne . twei sostren þer were
Of engelonde iboren her . þat longe hedden be þere .
Þe kinges sostren aþelwolde . þat as ich vnderstonde .
King was þo of þe souþ . ende of engelonde .
Þes sostren beden seint Botulf . þat he to here broþer wende
& to dame sware þe quene . & lettres to him hi sende .
Þat he grantede þis holi mon . in som stude aplace
Whare he miȝte an ordre biginne . þorw owre lordes grace .
Þis holi mon seint Botulf . to engelonde wende
And bitok hem þe lettres . þat me hem sende .
Þe king it wiþsede . & nolde it grante nouȝt
Ac þe quene þat was god . turnde anon his þouȝt .
Vor wimmen beþ eþe . to ech godnesse to bringe
Heo criede boþe niȝt and daẏ . on hire lord þe kinge .
Þo heo ne miȝte þer of . habbe non oþer grace
Seint botulf bad atelaste . granten him aplace .
Somwhare in som wildernesse . þat nomon ne knewe
Ne þer treo ne fruit . ne no god on ne grewe .
Þe king grantede him . to bileue in such an ende
Þo he seiȝ þat hit nolde . to noni harm him wende .
¶ A stude per was in wildernesse . þat nomon com þer for eiȝe
Þat was fol of luþere þinges . þis man þat hi biseiȝe .
Vor deuelen & luþre gostes . here ese hadden þere
And woneden þer at wille . vor none men þer nere .
¶ Þo to seint Botulf . þis stude igranted was
Baldeliche he wende þider . agast noþing he nas .
He wende to chese him astude . whar inne he miȝte be
Þo þe deuelen seiȝen him come . hi bigonne to vleo .
And bigonnne to crie . & grisliche to grede
¶ Botulf what woltou her . what is vs to rede .
Þis haþ beo ȝare oure hom . we wenden siker to beo
As in oure owe til domes daẏ . we nute whoder to fleo .

Whi woltou vs henne driue . we nabbeþ þe nouȝt mis do .

And þis is so wrecchede her . me þinkeþ þou hast wow .

¶ Seint Botulf in oure lordes name . wende forþ anon
Baldeliche as in is owe . þe deueles vlowe echon .
Seint Botulf in oure lordes name . of a luþer place þer
An holi abbei of monkes . he let sone arere .
& nom monkes to him . & a gret couent inow
Him self was abbot . and to lif  hem drow .
Of þat ilke woning . þe deueles he out caste
He made þer an holi stude . þat longo schal ilaste .

And to þe blisse of heuene . is soule gan þenne wende .
How god for þe loue of him . his swete grace vs sende
Þat we mote to þe ioie come . & so þe deueles schende. Amen
